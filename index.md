### CPSC 120

* Lab 4, part 2 

    I thought that this lab was interesting since it was the first time I got to use If statements. It allowed us to branch out to different options depending on the If statements requirement and user input. I also learned that If statements with integers have many uses with the greater than and less than symbol.

* Lab 7 

    This lab was fun due to the If statements having many more requirements which would determine if it was legal to park on certain streets. There were mainly two things that I learned from this lab. The first thing was using and/or in the If statements to make them more complex. The second thing was limiting the number of words a user could put into the command line, and putting those words into a vector to use later.

* Lab 10 

    This lab was my favorite because it was the one that I put all my efforts into completing. I had to do this lab alone due to the lab class happening during thanksgiving break. I had many failed attempts, but eventually I figured it out and learned how to use For loops to navigate a 2D vector.
